""I felt a very slight rush but began to doubt that anything was going to happen. A few minutes later, my attention was drawn to a colorful tortilla chip bag on the table, which somehow seemed more vibrantly colored than it had been before. Suddenly, the most strong and pleasant desire to sleep came over me. I had never felt so relaxed. I fell asleep and the dreams I had were vibrant and musical: I dreamt that an orchestra was playing very loudly on stage.""","How realistic does this cannabis experience sound:
""My first bowl hit was crazy; as soon as I smoked it I started to get crazy laughs and felt the best I have ever felt in my life. We were sitting there laughing and having a good time until we went inside the house and then the couch began to feel like a trampoline. He told me to lie down on it because he thought it would be funnier if I fell off, but I didn't think it was very funny when I woke up next morning on the floor with no shirt on...""","Have you used MDMA/XTC?","How realistic does this MDMA/XTC experience sound:
""When these feelings subsided, I was flooded with love. For myself and for others. I felt the importance of communication and contact. I knew that it would be imperative to maintain contact during this period of isolation and that I have a responsibility to my professors and classmates to continue to work through this as usual to give their work meaning. I felt I owe it to everyone to be stable and strong, because this will give them strength too. I remember weeping during these thoughts. I felt as though I was directing the trip at this point.""","How realistic does this MDMA/XTC experience sound:
""After about twenty minutes I started to feel really strange, then my friend said she didn't feel anything yet, so I gave her half of my pill. My heart began beating fast, and I told her to sit down because we might start dancing around or something, which would be bad since we were at my friends house (who also gave us the pill) and his parents were there. Then my head became super fuzzy, and my legs felt really hot.""","Have you used LSD?","How realistic does this LSD experience sound:
""Like with all acid trips, after the ego loss it all comes flooding back and I felt a part of the future, the past and the present, I looked into the past and made insights into the future. Just started enjoying being again, enjoying the taste of food and having a lust to learn again. The day continued and lots more happened that day, but they more revolved around life choices and making my friends, family and loved ones feel loved.""","How realistic does this LSD experience sound:
""First I noticed a picture on the wall start to swirl, then it started bending and moving slowly across the wall. Soon it moved past into another room where the colors melted together into a smooth blur of color. The floor beneath me also moved and began to breathe with a steady, smooth rhythm like ocean waves.""","Have you used Salvia Divinorum?","How realistic does this Salvia Divinorum experience sound:
""I normally would be relieved to get rid of the nasty taste, but had gotten used to it and was feeling very numb so did not care that it was gross. While before I had been just very disoriented, with things appearing odd and different, I suddenly COULD NOT SEE anything real around me. Everything real faded away. I mean I had a complete and total hallucination, but believed I was really in it. It’s hard to describe but was like this: I’m in a giant forest, with like a field in it, and there’s big trees and really tall grass, all bizarre colors and what-have-you.""","How realistic does this Salvia Divinorum experience sound:
""They then offered me some salvia out of their pipe. It felt like someone just gave me a 50 foot bong hit! I was spinning around so hard that when I closed my eyes I was looking at myself standing on the couch. Then I heard something inside my head say “You better open your fucking eyes because if you don’t you are going to fall over and kill yourself!”""","Have you used Mushrooms?","How realistic does this Mushroom experience sound:
""My soul was flying freely around the universe and I was actually meeting a lot of people. I couldn't see much but blue soul-like figures floating around on blue hover-craft-like vehicles. There was a young boy, and old man and a mean goblin like character. I was running around in the darkness asking everyone what 'The Truth' was. Everyone was telling me hints about 'The Truth' until finally I made my way into a tiny hole in the sleeping bag. The goblin popped his head out which exhausted red puffs of smoke with white outlines.""","How realistic does this Mushroom experience sound:
""They tasted really bad because we chewed them, but they weren't too bad. We started watching this DVD I borrowed from another friend and then we both felt the body high coming on. But then after 20 minutes or so, the DVD started lagging so we turned off the TV and listened to some music. Then I said I should go lie down because I couldn't really focus on anything anymore, which was a slight bummer cause that movie looked like hella fun to watch. So I laid on my bed and stared at the ceiling for a while as the effects became much stronger.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""Next thing I know, I am looking at my friends sitting on the opposing couch and their bodies began to blend into the pattern on the couch and slowly get vacuumed up into a vortex like point in the wall above them. This is similar to the experience I had the day before with the 7x salvia extract, but much more intense. At this point I had begun my journey into a disillusioned reality. I think the best way to describe it is disassociation with my surrounding and with myself as a being.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""At the time of this trip I had done acid exactly once before. It was one of those perfect trips, you know how they are. I felt everything for the first time and saw beautiful patterns everywhere. A few weeks later, however, my tolerance rose enough that I had been unable to achieve anything even close to that original trip. Finally my friend came through with some excellent blotter.I dropped 2 hits at about 8 PM.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""My ceiling in my room is textured, not smooth, and this served as an origin point for my most intense visuals. Lights on, lying on my back, my ceiling blossomed into a wave of shifting patterns, which grew quite intense at times. I would compare this to a low dose of psilocybin mushrooms. I also saw small pinpoints of bright, neon-coloured lights within the patterns. Upon turning my gaze to my walls and artwork on them, the patterns spread to there too, with similar intensity. In fact, things seemed to actually move slightly.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""I also had hallucinations but these weren't too bad. It was more like having visions instead of actually seeing things that aren't there. For example, I thought that I could feel my heartbeat everywhere in my body. It felt like my blood was going through me at high speeds; this made me feel really weird but wasn't unpleasant. The other thing which happened was that sometimes when I closed my eyes I saw coloured shapes which were very fast moving.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""I felt like I was in a cave inside my brain. My ego and inhibitions regarding what I thought dropped completely. I was able to talk freely about what I sensed from T and the strangers around me. My people intuition was brutally honest, yet caring. At some point T and I were near the water where he explained how much he loved the water, boat houses, and birds. I was able to connect these three things and became T. I felt as though I were him, sensing all feelings, hopes, etc. i completely understood him, understood how others saw him, and how he saw himself.""","How coherent does this text sound?
""My heart rate felt like it was going crazy (I still get that feeling sometimes now). It sounded like my heart was thumping against my chest and pounding really hard (it was actually a bit scary). But during this whole thing I wasn't scared or anything. The other thing that happened was my head felt fuzzy and I felt like I couldn't think straight."""
